# On The Map

The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs.

First, the user logs in to the app using their Udacity username and password. After login, the app downloads locations and links previously posted by other students.

After viewing the information posted by other students, a user can post their own location and link. The locations are specified with a string and forward geocoded.

The app has three view controller scenes:
- Login View: Allows the user to log in using their Udacity credentials, or using their Facebook account
- Map and Table Tabbed View: Allows users to see the locations of other students in two formats.  
- Information Posting View: Allows the users specify their own locations and links.
